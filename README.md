Future Turtles 2026 Public LED Display
====

In 2024 we
* upped the number of whips to 24
* got rid of the central antenna
* improved cabling via daisy chaining

For 2026 we
* made the box at the foot of each whip smaller
* hard wired those boxes instead of using external connectors
* used two sources of power so that 16awg wires are adequate
